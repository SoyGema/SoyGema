### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Gema!

I love Data and Machine Learning and I'm passionate about videogames!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Data Science and Machine Learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Python and AI Alignment.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science and Machine Learnig projects !
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning fundamentals, Deepmind pysc2 project and getting on with large language models!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: at twitter @SoyGema

### Portofolio
+[Dice Game Probability exercise](https://github.com/SoyGema/Portfolio/blob/main/DataExploration/Dice_Game_Probability.ipynb) In this exercise you can see more about how I structure code and solve some probabilistic questions taking into account a Dice-Game. Find the challenge description [here](https://github.com/SoyGema/Portfolio/blob/main/DataExploration/README.md) and code above.

+[Data Exploration Squirrels Dataset](https://github.com/SoyGema/Portfolio/blob/main/DataExploration/Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb) General Data Science exploration : In this exercise you can see more about how I think from an analytical perspective and which tools I use for data exploration.

### Open Source Tutorials

+[StarCraft 2 Codelab](https://soygema.github.io/starcraftII_machine_learning/#0) In this project I've created a codelab to share with the community some of the machine learning fundamentals I've learnt about open source research with StarCraft 2 DeepMind project.

+[Satellite orbit prediction with DVC VSCode Open Source extension](https://github.com/iterative/VSCode-DVC-Workshop) Workshop given at PyDayBCN 2022. In this workshop we predict kinematic orbit for 600 Satellites making machine learning experiments with Multioutput Random Forest Regressor.  

### Research Projects

+[NeuRIPS 2020](https://cupdf.com/document/benchmarking-imitation-and-reinforcement-learning-for-.html?page=1) Participation in NeuRIPS 2020 Workshop WordPlay: When language meets games with the videogame Mempathy. This projects benchmarks some experiments with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning in language oriented games.

+[ICML 2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iATyd80yYMKoV-WPzV0_hYntYbpwvlZS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109726716116488916327&rtpof=true&sd=true) Poster session in WiML Unworkshop. 

### Machine Learning and videogames blogposts

+[StarCraft II Unplugged](https://medium.com/p/1c9192fc03b) BlogPost about latest developments released by Deepmind at NeuRIPS2021 DRL workshop. It includes figures and videos made to interpret and communicate papers results.

+[Interactive Narrative control : safety and aligment of language agents](https://medium.com/p/2be8eb7636a9) Technical blogpost article about PPLM research implementation for Mempathy.
