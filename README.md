<summary>Portfolio</summary>


+[Dice Game Probability exercise](https://github.com/SoyGema/Portfolio/blob/main/DataExploration/Dice_Game_Probability.ipynb) In this exercise you can see more about how I structure code and solve some probabilistic questions taking into account a Dice-Game. Find the challenge description [here](https://github.com/SoyGema/Portfolio/blob/main/DataExploration/README.md) and code above.

+[Data Exploration Squirrels Dataset](https://github.com/SoyGema/Portfolio/blob/main/DataExploration/Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb) General Data Science exploration : In this exercise you can see more about how I think from an analytical perspective and which tools I use for data exploration.
